# zk-context
Sample Project Illustrating listbox context popup issue in ZK8

@ref requires ZK EE or ZK PE .. I have EE so that's what the pom has in it.

Change the zk.version number in the pom to 8.0.0 and you'll see the right click popup on the listbox no longer works.

NOTE: using the included buildAndDeploy will deploy to your TOMCAT_HOME. (copyZul script I use to quickly modify zul's
to the exploded war for testing things.)
